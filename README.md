# Atom Markdown Builder

A Marked.app builder for Atom.

This is a plugin for the latest version of
[atom-build](https://atom.io/packages/build), which is a package that lets you
run build scripts based on what files are in your project. This plugin, in
particular, will launch `Marked.app` (or `Marked 2.app` in the upcoming version)
on Mac OS X if you try to build a file whose name ends in `.md` or `.mkd`. If
you use Linux or Windows, and have a favourite Markdown previewer, I would love
to add support for those, too!
